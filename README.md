# Weather_Tracker
An app to track the weather based on a location the user specifies

## Description
This webpage acts as a weather dashboard to view the current weather and the five day forecast. Users are able to search by city name and the page will pull data from Open Weather API to display the next 5 days of weather. Data pulled includes the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon indicating the expected conditions. Previously searched cities are saved in the history and the user can click on these to pull up the weather for those saved searches.
